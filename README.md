# Music-Website
Website to play music.
A music website is essentially a web page designed to enable users to control the playback and pausing of music. It typically incorporates specific sections, such as "New Songs" and "Old Songs," among others. In this project, the goal is to create a website that provides music play and pause functionality using HTML and CSS, while allowing users to explore these extra sections like "New Songs", "Old Songs", etc for access to a wide variety of songs and content.
