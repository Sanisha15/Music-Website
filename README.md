# Music-Website
A music website is essentially a web page designed to enable users to control the playback and pausing of music, incorporating specific sections like "New Songs" and "Old Songs." In this project, the goal is to create a comprehensive website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing play and pause functionality alongside sections for exploring various songs and content. The website will offer play, pause, forward, and backward options, enhancing the music experience for users.
